%This is to describe the nice parameters to try

Flat surface and sine walls
t_final = 5
wx = -1
wy = 1

Flat surface and tilted sine walls
t_final = 5
wx = 0
wy = 1

Flat surface and tilted sine walls
t_final = 7
wx = 1
wy = 5

Flat surface and tilted sine walls
t_final = 7
wx = -1
wy = 5
Note: many WARNING messages appear as expected

Gaussian dome surface and tilted walls
t_final = 0.75
wx = 0
wy = 1
Note: It takes about 4 minutes to run and is not super nice, but the result makes sense
Note: The program runs for much much longer with a larger time
        (it seems it would take about 25 minutes to run with t=0.85)

Flat surface sine walls
t_final = 5
wx = -1
wy = 1

Flat surface sine walls
t_final = 5
wx = -2
wy = 1
